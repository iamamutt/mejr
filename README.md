# mejr

An R package for importing a set of commonly used, general purpose functions and custom R options.

## Dependencies

- R: <https://www.r-project.org/>

A current R installation.

- `devtools` package: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/>

So that you can install the GitHub contents as an R package. You can install the package by opening up RStudio or an R terminal and running:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

- Build tools: <http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>

For Windows users, you may be required to install Rtools first before you can use the `devtools` package. These are a set of build tools customized for building R packages (see `devtools` link for more details).


## How to install

Once `devtools` is installed, youâ€™ll use the `install_github()` function
from the package to download and install the package from this GitHub
repository. Run the code below to download and install:

``` r
devtools::install_github("iamamutt/mejr", dependencies=TRUE)
```

If successful, the package should now be installed. Load the package as you normally would any other package (see below). Repeat these steps if there are updates to the package or to reinstall on another computer. You should now be able to use the package materials and should see it in your packages tab if using RStudio.

``` r
library(mejr)
```
