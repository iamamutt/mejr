\name{sd2}
\alias{sd2}
\title{Custom standard deviation}
\usage{
sd2(x, fun = mean, correction = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector}

\item{fun}{summary statistic, measure of central tendency. Defaults to
\code{mean}}

\item{correction}{bias correction amount (e.g. 1.5), defaults to 1.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to fun}
}
\value{
scalar
}
\description{
Inject a different summary statistic for the mean and adjust the bias
correction term
}
\details{
The square root of the euclidean distance from some central value (determined
by the summary statistic function \code{fun}) and divided by the length of
\code{x} minus some correction value is returned.
}
\examples{
x <- rgamma(100, 1, 1)
sd(x)                    # standard
sd2(x)                   # same as above
sd2(x, correction=1.5)   # 1.5 bias correction
sd2(x, logmean, 1)       # geometric mean, correction=1
sd2(x, logmean, 1.5)     # geometric mean, correction=1.5
