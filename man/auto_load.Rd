  repos = getOption("repos"))
}

\description{
This will automatically download a character vector of package names. If they
are already installed, it will update them (optional).
}
\details{
This will only try to retreive packages from CRAN. It is good to load this at
the beginning of a script If you want others to automatically download
packages or give a script for someone to run with dependencies You can set
\code{update.all} to \code{FALSE} if you don't want to try and update the
packages each time it is run.

auto_load(ggplot2, "data.table")
