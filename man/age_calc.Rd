\item{dob}{Date of birth string that the function \code{\link{ymd}} and 
others like it can understand. Typically in the format "yyyy-mm-dd" or "yyyy/mm/dd"}

\item{ref}{Reference date string. Either today's date or some other time after 
\code{dob} Defaults to today.}

\item{lub.fmt}{Lubridate function for the input dates, such as 
\code{\link{ymd}} or any function that returns a \code{POSIXct} format.

}

Numeric value of age in months
}
\description{
Calculates ages in months with decimal days from date of birth until up to some point
}

If you're going to use a reference date, make sure the format for both dob 
and ref are the same. For example, don't use ymd for dob and mdy for ref. 
You'll get wrong values.
